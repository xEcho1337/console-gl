# Console Game Library (CGL)

Console Game Library (CGL) is a lightweight and intuitive game framework designed for building interactive applications directly in the console or terminal.

Unlike traditional game engines that rely on pixels and GPU rendering, CGL uses ASCII characters as its rendering units. All computations and rendering are handled entirely on the CPU, making it simple, portable, and dependency-free.
